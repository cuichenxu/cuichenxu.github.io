臭申琳想把这个地方的内容换掉，不好意思，留不得你们了。但是加什么她也没有说，我也没有什么东西要放上。

GitHub Pages uses a Markdown engine called <dfn>kramdown</dfn> for formatting text posts. kramdown is a superset of Markdown, meaning:

1. anything that’s valid Markdown is also valid kramdown, and
2. it provides and strictly specifies a number of features that are not available in Markdown.[^1] 

Consult the official [kramdown syntax reference][kds] for an exhaustive list of features and how to use them.

[^1]:
    Such as footnotes.
